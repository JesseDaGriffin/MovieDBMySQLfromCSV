Calvin and Sarah are thinking about getting married when they meet Julie, who doesn\'t swing, and isn\'t bisexual - until she falls for Calvin. Psychodrama almost displaces sex for Shannon and Gerard, who are passionate about swinging, even as they question whether the lifestyle is really for them...',0.014406,'2002-02-22',0,0,'Released','','Sex With Strangers',5,1),(102899,130000000,'http://marvel.com/movies/movie/180/ant-man','en','Ant-Man',_binary 'Armed with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, master thief Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Doctor Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats.
